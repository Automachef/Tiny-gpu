A minimal GPU implementation in Verilog

Companies building GPUs have kept all the technical details proprietary. They only release high-level architecture overviews. I've had to reverse engineer how everything works and try to break it down to a simple level that's implementable in a project like this by inferring how things must work from the little available information there is, and with the help of Claude Opus.

The cool element of this is that if I can figure it out, it will be the first public learning resource on this with an actual implementation people can dive into to develop an intuition for how things work.

This project is going to be sick, I'm excited!
